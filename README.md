## Description

Various sorting and searhing algorithms implemented in C. All designed for 32-bit unsigned integers.

## Algorithms

- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Quick sort
- Merge sort
- Bucket sort
- Radix sort
- Binary search


## Contents

- `sorting.c` - Contains function definitions for sorting algorithms.
- `sorting.h` - Corresponding header file with function declarations.
- `sorttest.c` - Tests the algorithms sort correctly.
- `searchtest.c` - Tests the search algorithms.
- `speedtest.c` - Times the execution speed of the algorithms.

## Speed Test

***TODO - test results go here***
